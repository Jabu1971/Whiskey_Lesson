		<h2 class="text-muted mt-3">Whiskey or Whisky—How to Spell It?</h2>
		<p class="lead">As spelling mistakes go, you can do a lot worse than mixing up whisky and whiskey. Spelling mistakes can be embarrassing and funny, and there are always those that can get you into trouble. Really?</p>
		<p>We are told, by those in the 'know', that both spellings of the word, whiskey and whisky, are correct. The tricky part is matching the right spelling with the right country of origin, not.</p>

		<p>According to the <mark>Spelling Police</mark>, when referring to a drink made in Scotland, Canada, or Japan, use the spelling without the e—whisky. When talking about a drink distilled in the United States or Ireland, use the e—whiskey. When pronouncing the words, you wouldn’t notice the difference, but it is apparent in writing.</p>
		<p>My brother,Sipho, who doesn't have a clue when it comes to these matters, and who is terrible with spelling, WhatsApp-ed me(yes, it's a word) sent me this msg: </p>
		<p class="blockquote mark">I had a glass of "Irish" <b>whisky</b> last night; it was OK, but it’s no "Scotch" <b>whiskey.</b></p>

	<h2 class="text-muted">The Difference Between Whiskey and Whisky</h2>
	<p>Does the spelling difference have to do with anything besides the country of origin? Are all whisk(e)ys made one way and all whiskies made another way?</p>
	<p>Not really. If you look at American, Scottish, and Irish whiskeys, you’ll notice that there are a few rules about how the liquor is made in those countries, but they have nothing to do with the spelling.</p>
	<p>A whisky can be distilled two times, as they usually do it in Scotland, and a whiskey can also be distilled two times, as they do it the United States. In Ireland, however, a whiskey is usually distilled three times. So the difference between a whiskey and a whisky just depends on the country of origin, and it would be wrong to say that all whiskeys or all whiskies are alike</p>
